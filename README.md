# Punnett Ponies

## even if not strictly punnett squares or ponies

A toy for simple horse colour genetics.
May be integrated into another use eventually (game?).

It was originally on Gatsby but it really didn't make sense there so now it's on CRA (create react app).

TO DO

- material ui
- fix selects (value etc)
- style it a bit better
- add breed one
- start info boxes
- start gene turn on/off page
- figure out percentage! - then figure out to use it in data visualization lib!

### Phase 1:

BASE COATS ONLY Genes: Agouti, Red/Black Factor or Extension (Aa, Ee) Covers colors: Bay, Red, Black Generated genetics of each colour is random Select or edit genetic alleles of horses Add info pages Add hover/click quick info

Find a way to add percentages (maybe not add it yet but look into it and play with it)

### Phase 2:

Add Roan, Grey
Add Cream, Dun
Add compare any 2 modifiers
Graphics - basic animations?
Add percentages

### Phase 3:

Add other dilutions
Add basic patterns
Improve graphics/animations
Add greying animation

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
